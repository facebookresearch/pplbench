    Noisy-Or Topic Model aka Latent Keyphrase Inference (LAKI)

    Reference paper: http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/pdf/www16_jliu.pdf

    This is a Bayesian Network with boolean-valued random variables and Noisy-OR
    dependencies. The internal nodes of the network represent "topics" while the
    leaf nodes represent "words". Note that topics can be parents of other topics
    or words and there is a special "leak" node which is the parent of all the nodes.

    These nodes are assigned numbers as follows, node 0 is the special leak node
    followed by `num_topics` topic nodes and finally `num_words` word nodes.

    The leak node is always active (or true) and the inference task is to
    determine the values of the topic nodes given the values of all the word nodes.

    The model consists of a matrix `edge_weight`, s.t. edge_weight[j, k] is the
    edge weight (>=0) from parent node k to child node j. A high edge weight
    suggests that j will likely be true when k is true while a weight of zero
    indicates that there is no direct dependence between j and k.

    We are interested in learning the boolean vector `active` of size 1+num_topics.

    Hyper Parameters:

        n - number of sentences this is fixed to two
        num_topics - number of topics
        num_words - number of words
        avg_fanout - average number of children of a topic
        avg_leak_weight - average weight of a leak-to-node edge
        avg_topic_weight - average weight of a topic-to-node edge

    Model:

        initialize edge_weight[1 + num_topics + num_words, 1 + num_topics] = 0

        for j in 1 .. (num_topics + num_words)
            edge_weight[j, 0] ~ Exp(avg_leak_weight)

        for k in 1 .. num_topics

            draw a subset J from the set {k+1 .. num_topics+num_words}
                s.t. |J| ~ max(1, Poisson(avg_fanout))

            for j in J
                edge_weight[j, k] ~ Exp(avg_topic_weight)

        active[0] = 1

        for k in 1 .. num_topics

            prob_k = 1 - exp( - sum_{l=0}^{k-1} edge_weight[k, l] * active[l] )
            active[k] ~ Bernoulli( prob_k )

        for i in 1 .. n

            for j in 1 .. num_words

                prob_j = 1 - exp( - sum_{l=0}^{num_topics} edge_weight[num_topics+j, l] * active[l] )

                S[i, j] ~ Bernoulli( prob_j )


    The dataset consists of

        S[sentence, word] : {0, 1}  ; sentence=0..n-1,  word=0..num_words-1

    and it includes the attributes

        n                                                          = 1
        num_topics                                                 : integer >= 1
        num_words                                                  : integer >= 1
        edge_weight[1 + num_topics + num_words, 1 + num_topics]    : float

    The posterior samples should include

        active[draw, topic] : {0, 1}    topic=0..num_topics

    note that active[:, 0] should always be 1
