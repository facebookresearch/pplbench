# Contributing to PPL Bench

We welcome any contributions - whether it is adding a new model, adding a new PPL  implementation, or modifying an existing PPL implementation.

### How to add a new PPL?

To add a new PPL, first, create a new directory in `pplbench/ppl`. Then, create a base implementation that future implementations of the PPL can use. You can refer to `pplbench/ppls/stan/base_stan_impl.py` as an example.

This base PPL implementation must inherit from `BasePPLImplementation`.


### How to add a new model?

To add a new model, create a new file in `pplbench/models`. The model will need to inherit from `BaseModel` and implement two methods â€” `generate_data` and `evaluate_posterior_predictive`.

`generate_data` should return the train and test data by simulating from the generative model.

`evaluate_posterior_predictive` should return the predictive log likelihood of the data given samples from the inferred parameters.
