## Purpose of PPL Bench

The purpose of PPL Bench as a probabilistic programming benchmark is two-fold.

1) To provide researchers with a framework to evaluate improvements in PPLs in a standardized setting.
2) To enable users to pick the PPL that is most suited for their modeling application.

Typically, comparing different ML systems requires duplicating huge segments of work: generating data, running analysis, determining predictive performance, and comparing across implementations. PPL Bench automates nearly all of this workflow.
