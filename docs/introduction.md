## What is PPL Bench?

PPL Bench is a new benchmark framework for evaluating the performance of probabilistic programming languages (PPLs).

## Using PPL Bench

* Comparing model performance across PPLs
* Comparing the effectiveness of interference algorithms across models
* Evaluating new inference algorithms

## Purpose of PPL Bench

The purpose of PPL Bench as a probabilistic programming benchmark is two-fold.

1) To provide researchers with a framework to evaluate improvements in PPLs in a standardized setting.
2) To enable users to pick the PPL that is most suited for their modelling application.

Typically, comparing different ML systems requires duplicating huge segments of work: generating data, running analysis, determining predictive performance, and comparing across implementations. PPL Bench automates nearly all of this workflow.
